How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It compares both files and show differences between them.
    So that, you can make your own changes in the code.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see different methods of programming just by analising those codes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro: there won't be lots of diferent versions, which will help you if you need to check them later.
    Con: you have to remember saving the changes you made in the code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In order to make ii easy for those ones who do not know about programming.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use them whenever I need to see any chance was made in the code.
    Git log shows all the commits while git diff shows only one especific commit.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    So that I can easily find an error in the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Improve my programming skills.
